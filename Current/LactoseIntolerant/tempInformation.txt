for the glitch where it gets stuck in the other car or glitches to the other side or whatever, try using
player.turningRight or player.turningLeft or whatever it's called to tell since the player turns in too 
far to one side then the collisions thinks it's coming from the other side...


for harder AIs, increase noEffectDecrease and ACCELERATION   !! :)
