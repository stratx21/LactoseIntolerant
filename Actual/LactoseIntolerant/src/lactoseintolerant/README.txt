**INSTRUCTIONS**

- Move your car fowards to the end of the level as fast as possible to beat the missions and win.
*IN THE GARAGE*
- This will be the first screen you come to, with your first mission written across the middle.
	From here, you can start any mission up to and including the current one, you can go to
	the upgrades button at the bottom to upgrade cars, you can go to the team menu to hire
	help evading your taxes, or you can click the menu, which will give you options to change
	settings in the game as well as the option to quit.
- Under the upgrades tab is where you manage what cars you have and what upgrades you have bought
	for them.
- To choose a car and weapon (if you have bought any thusfar), simply click the weapon and it will
	automatically be used when you start your next mission.
*IN THE GAME PLAY*
- The 'W', 'S', 'A', and 'D' keys on your keyboard are the keys used to control your car:
	'W': Forwards
	'A': Left
	'S': Backwards
	'D': Right
- The red/green bar on the right side is your progress bar (going from bottom to top).  Once it is
	full, you have completed the mission and can proceed to the next mission.
- The timer in the top left-hand corner of the screen is so that you can keep track of your
	time so far.  It can be used together with the progress bar to determine if you are
	improving or becoming more slowed down by the Sheepmania Tax Collectors (STC).
- The red bar in the top left-hand corner of the screen is your health bar.  If you get hit it
	will lessen till there is no bar left.  When there is no bar left, the mission is over and
	you have lost that mission.
- The blue bar in the top left-hand corner of the screen is your speed bar.  Hold down 'W' and go
	as fast as possible (the faster you go the bigger the bar gets).
- The green bar in the top left-hand corner of the screen is your abilities bar.  When it is full
	just press the Spacebar to use your selected ability (selected in Garage).  The green bar
	will automatically empty when you use your ability and slowly fill back up over a set time.
